# 6.0002---MIT
Here are my solutions to the problem sets in 6.0002 taught on MIT OCW and edX.
Unfortunately, I could not finish this course.
The problem sets in OCW and edX are the same. I have done them from OCW. Since the edX course that I was taking did not have Problem Set 2 on OCW, I think there might be an error there.
